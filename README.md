# Git Workflow

**Author:** Massimo Lesti


**Due date:** 2/2/16

## Description

You gotta take the file and add your own name and words and stuff, not unlike what I am currently doing.

## What I Learned from This

How to get files from GitHub and mess with them in Atom or other editors. Also started to learn how to do markdown in GitHub.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

_Massimo Lesti_
